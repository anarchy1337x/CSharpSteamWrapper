This is the repository for ideas for my upcoming steam wrapper. Please make a issue with the feature you'd like to see!


**Current Features**
- Logging in.
- Grab logged in user's games.
- Grab game's playtime + appid.
- Handle exceptions for types of login failures (SUCCES, INVALID_ACCOUNT, PROXY_ERROR, RATELIMIT)
